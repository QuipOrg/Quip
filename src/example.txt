// Authentication
// Can be more that just that but username and password are must.

backend: Backend = new Backend();

this.auth.register({
      username: 'Tanner',
      password: 'password'
    }).subscribe(_ => this.router.navigate(['profile']));

// this will give u the profile data.
this.actions.fetch<Profile>(this.backend.profile)

// this will save a post to the database same with comments and the others
this.actions.save<Post>(this.backend.post)

All you need to do is make services for comments, posts like auth and that'd be good

All the routes are in Backend.ts in interfaces folder.
